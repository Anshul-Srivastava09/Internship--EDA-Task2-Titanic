🔍 Steps Performed

Loaded dataset (titanic.csv) and checked structure using .info(), .describe().

Checked missing values and visualized with heatmap.

Univariate analysis: histograms, boxplots, and countplots.

Bivariate analysis: relationships between survival vs age, gender, and class.

Correlation heatmap for numeric features.

Group-level analysis (e.g., survival by Pclass and Sex).

📊 Key Findings

Females had significantly higher survival rates compared to males.

Passengers in 1st Class had higher chances of survival compared to 2nd/3rd Class.

Younger passengers showed slightly better survival than older ones.

Higher fare correlated with better survival chances (proxy for socio-economic class).
